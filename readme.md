Project Overview
This project is a basic RESTful API built with Node.js and Express. It retrieves user data stored in a JSON file and serves it through various GET endpoints. 

The main objectives were:
To create a RESTful API.
Make use of the fs module to read JSON files.
To show error handling for invalid requests.

What I Learned
How to set up a Node.js project with Express.
Creating and testing RESTful API endpoints.
Using the fs module to interact with JSON data.

Each screenshot includes:
/users – Listing all users.
/users/:id – Retrieving users by ID.
/users/profession/:profession – Filtering users by profession.
/users/name/:name – Fetching users by name.
Error handling for invalid IDs, professions, and names.

Discussion
This project was an insightful introduction to building RESTful APIs. It provided hands-on experience with Express and the fs module, reinforcing concepts like routing and error handling. Testing the endpoints with Postman allowed me to verify the API's functionality and ensure it met the expected behavior.

Challenges
Main challenge I faced was with error handling.
